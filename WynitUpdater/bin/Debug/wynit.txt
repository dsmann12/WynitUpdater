Forerunner 620 features recovery advisor, race predictor and VO2 max estimate so you can train smarter. When used with the HRM-Run monitor¹, the 620 also gives you feedback on your running form by showing your cadence, ground contact time and vertical oscillation. For indoor training, the built-in accelerometer tracks distance, so you don’t need a separate foot pod.It Knows Your PotentialForerunner 620 can estimate your VO2 max, your body’s maximal oxygen consumption. Knowing your VO2 max is a great way to measure your physical fitness and improve your performance. When used with a heart rate monitor, the 620 crunches data, including your running speed, beats per minute and heart rate variability to estimate your VO2 max. The number itself indicates the maximum volume of oxygen you can consume per minute, per kilogram of body weight at your max performance.A color gauge on the watch shows how your VO2 max data compares to other runners of your gender and age range. Based on your VO2 max estimate, the 620 can predict your race times for several distances. This can give you a time target for your next race, assuming you’ve completed proper training.Train and Race The Way You WantForerunner 620 features separate activity profiles for Ride/Race/Run, and makes it easy to switch between them, for viewing only the information you want to see. The “Ride” profile defaults to speed instead of pace, sets the activity as cycling for Garmin Connect, and supports cycling speed and pedaling cadence measurements when paired with Garmin wireless speed and cadence sensors. The “Race” profile is an additional running profile that allows you to set up and quickly switch to different data fields for races than those you use for day-to-day training.Rest Day or Run DayWith Forerunner 620, you don’t have to guess how much recovery time you need between workouts. It knows your physiology based on your heart rate data, so it factors this against your last workout and then shows how much time before you are fully recovered and ready for your next hard running workout.When wearing HRM-Run, the 620 provides a recovery check, which is a real-time indication of your state of recovery within the first several minutes of your run. When you’ve completed a run, the recovery time shows how long before you should attempt another hard workout. Color coding on the gauge makes it easy to interpret — green means you’re good to go. When you see red and a recovery time of more than 3 days, you might consider taking a rest day or just doing a light recovery run.Following Your FormThe 620 is the first GPS running watch that provides feedback on your running form by reporting multiple metrics. When used with the HRM-Run monitor¹, the 620 reports your cadence, vertical oscillation and ground contact time. These metrics are called running dynamics, and they effect your running economy.The HRM-Run has an accelerometer, which measures your torso movement as you run to compute these metrics. Cadence is the total number of steps you take per minute, left and right foot combined. Vertical oscillation is the degree of “bounce” in your running motion, measured in centimeters. Ground contact time is just like it sounds — the amount of time your foot spends on the ground during each running step, measured in milliseconds. A color gauge makes it easy to see how your running dynamics compare to other runners.¹Included with some models, sold	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/010N112800_300.jpg	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/010N112800.jpg

The result - Edge 520, the GPS bike computer that's right-sized for competitive cyclists and packed with the features you crave. Prove Your Edge Edge 520 is the first bike computer that's compatible with Strava live segments and includes a 2-month trial of Strava Premium. With this membership, your starred Strava segments automatically sync with the 520 for live feedback during your ride. You'll also get alerts for segment start and finish and leaderboard rankings once you complete the segment. Train on the Edge Need some motivation to get through those lonely miles on the indoor trainer? Edge 520 delivers with a suite of training capabilities when paired with compatible ANT+ indoor trainers. Let's say you want to train at an average power of 240 watts. Just set the target on Edge 520, start pedaling, and the trainer will automatically adjust to keep you at your target while the 520 shows your stats. You can also follow a course that you or another rider created and literally race the recorded stats, with the trainer adjusting resistance to match the elevation profile.Pair it with a power meter and Edge 520 offers an additional set of features, like FTP and watts/kg tracking, so you can compare yourself to others, as well as cycling dynamics. A built-in FTP test helps you establish your baseline either on the trainer or on the road. Add heart rate and the 520 can derive your VO2 max estimate and post-ride recovery time, which indicates how long before you should attempt another hard effort. Edge 520, the GPS bike computer that's right-sized for competitive cyclists and packed with the features you crave. Optimized Display Edge 520 compromises nothing when it comes to display - 2.3 inches of high-resolution color. We maximized the display so you get the most live area in relation to the compact size of the 520. You'll also appreciate the screen clarity in all lighting conditions. The Connected BikeEdge 520 is compatible with ANT+ sensors, including Varia&trade; bike radar and lights, speed, cadence, heart rate, Edge and VIRB&reg; remotes and compatible weight scales. It also integrates with Shimano Di2 electronic shifting systems to display your current gear on the screen. Edge 520 is also compatible with ANT+ power meters, including the Vector series.iLevels Compatibility Compatible Garmin Edge devices will now work with WKO4 individual power levels (iLevels), the newest metric for cyclists and triathletes who train with a power meter.

That's why you need more than navigation guidance. With its built-in dash cam, d&#275;zlCam LMTHD will capture and save footage of any collision, which can make all the difference when fault is being determined. The magnetic mount lets you easily secure or remove d&#275;zlCam from your truck. Whether mounted on your windshield or dashboard, the adjustable swivel lens gives you an optimal view of the road. It also features a large, 6.0-inch glass screen with pinch to zoom. d&#275;zlCam is essential equipment for truckers, pure and simple. Built-in Dash Cam The second you hit the road, d&#275;zlCam automatically records continuous HD video. In the event of a collision, the Incident Detection (G-sensor) automatically saves footage on impact. Or, you can manually save footage with the touch of a button. The unit can easily be removed from its magnetic mount, allowing you to take close-up pictures of any collision damage with the Snapshot feature. Optional GPS overlay provides location, speed, date and time to precisely record when and where an incident occurred. An 8 GB microSD&trade; card is included. Play back video footage directly on d&#275;zlCam's large 6.0-inch display. You can play back the video on your large, 6.0-inch display - and even view a map of where you were, at the time of the incident. If you like, you can even watch the video later on your computer using our Dash Cam Player. There's also a Snapshot feature on d&#275;zlCam that allows you to capture still images - and even remove the unit from your truck to take pictures of any collision damage. For storage of your recorded video data, a microSD&trade; card is included with your device.Helpful Road Warnings d&#275;zlCam has detailed maps for North America that also include truck-related restrictions - like bridge heights, sharp curves, weight limits and more - and related information for most major roads and highways. Customized Truck Routing Just enter your vehicle profile information (customizable by height, weight, length, width and hazardous materials) and find truck-preferred routes suitable for the size and weight of your truck. You can easily swap trailer sizes with the touch of a button. The onboard Trip Planner lets you create multiple-stop routes and plan and save future trips. Easy Route Shaping When you prefer to drive on certain streets or through specific towns, d&#275;zlCam lets you easily alter your drive. Easy Route Shaping lets you add one or more points to the route you see onscreen and d&#275;zlCam reconfigures the drive for you.Truck-specific POIs and Services Need help finding places to go? Locate POIs that truck drivers prefer - and have given high ratings - including truck stops, weigh stations, parking, lodging, Wi-Fi&reg; hot spots and more.

Overall training load, sleep, nutrition and general life stress play a role in how you will perform in a tough workout. To give you a better idea of what days you should aim for a tough workout or use as a recovery day, Forerunner 630 provides you with a stress score based off your heart rate. Performance condition is another feature that gives you an idea of how you will fare in a workout. As you run, this feature analyzes your pace, heart rate and heart rate variability to make a real-time assessment of your ability to perform. When planning a strategy for your next race, Forerunner 630 measures your VO2 max and can predict your race times for several distances, providing you with a time target.

Made in the USAFeatures420HC STEEL - This is Buck's standard blade material because it approaches the wear resistance of high carbon alloys while delivering the corrosion resistance of chromium stainless steels. Add our exclusive heat-treat process and you have a very user-friendly combination of superior corrosion resistance with excellent strength for wear resistance and durability. You also have a blade that is easy to resharpen. For best performance we harden to a Rockwell hardness of Rc 58.CLIP - The crescent tip makes the blade thinner with a sharper point. This shape provides good control for detail work and cutting in tight places. It is also well suited for intentional punctures like new holes in your belt, etc. While the point of the blade is effective for detail work, it's not as strong as the thicker points on drop points and skinners.	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/0110BRSFGB_300.jpg	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/0110BRSFGB.jpg

Made in the USAFeatures420HC STEEL - This is Buck's standard blade material because it approaches the wear resistance of high carbon alloys while delivering the corrosion resistance of chromium stainless steels. Add our exclusive heat-treat process and you have a very user-friendly combination of superior corrosion resistance with excellent strength for wear resistance and durability. You also have a blade that is easy to resharpen. For best performance we harden to a Rockwell hardness of Rc 58.CLIP - The crescent tip makes the blade thinner with a sharper point. This shape provides good control for detail work and cutting in tight places. It is also well suited for intentional punctures like new holes in your belt, etc. While the point of the blade is effective for detail work, it's not as strong as the thicker points on drop points and skinners.	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/0119BRSB_300.jpg	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/0119BRSB.jpg

The QuickFire has an advance design with dual springs to provide an easy and safe blade release. The "quick-firing" blade has a convenient one-hand ambidextrous deployment.

Equipped with a reliable 420HC blade steel and stylish steel reinforced handles, this knife is dependable and contemporary in design. Made in the USA Buck's. ASAP assisted opening knives are functionally different than automatic/switchblade knives. Switchblade knives use a button/lever in the handle to release the blade and the blade cannot be moved at all without entirely opening the knife. As with many things, knife laws change and vary from location to location. It is the user's responsibility to comply with all regulations.	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/0288BKS_300.jpg	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/0288BKS.jpg

Add our exclusive heat-treat process and you have a very user-friendly combination of superior corrosion resistance with excellent strength for wear resistance and durability. You also have a blade that is easy to resharpen. For best performance we harden to a Rockwell hardness of Rc 58.Drop PointThis blade is full bellied with a strong, thick point for heavier tasks. It can also be used as a general work knife. The top of the blade drops down toward the tip, which minimizes accidental puncturing while skinning. The drop point blade is strong and very versatile.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1033196570.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/650/1033196570.jpg

You also have a blade that is easy to resharpen. For best performance we harden to a Rockwell hardness of Rc 58.DROP POINT - This blade is full bellied with a strong, thick point for heavier tasks.

Made in the USA.420HC STEELThis is Buck's standard blade material because it approaches the wear resistance of high carbon alloys while delivering the corrosion resistance of chromium stainless steels. Add our exclusive heat-treat process and you have a very user-friendly combination of superior corrosion resistance with excellent strength for wear resistance and durability. You also have a blade that is easy to resharpen. For best performance we harden to a Rockwell hardness of Rc 58.DROP POINTThis blade is full bellied with a strong, thick point for heavier tasks. It can also be used as a general work knife. The top of the blade drops down toward the tip, which minimizes accidental puncturing while skinning. The drop point blade is strong and very versatile.	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/0525AFS_300.jpg	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/0525AFS.jpg

Rain, snow, or whatever Mother Nature can dish out, with this magnesium alloy fire starter, you'll be able to achieve the spark you need to get your fire going. The firesteel shaft is good for up to 3,000 strikes and the chrome-plated striker is easy to hold and use. A molded plastic handle makes it easy to use and a nylon cord keeps it handy when you need it. To get your fire going, all you'll need is a small pile of dry grass, wood shavings, or other flammable materials. Hold the magnesium firesteel shaft close to the pile and quickly draw the striker down the shaft at a right angle to produce sparks. The sparks will ignite the dry materials and, as the fire becomes established, you will be able to gradually add larger materials to the fire until it is at the desired size. The Kershaw Fire Starter also lights camp stoves and gas barbeques. In an emergency, the brilliant spark can be used as an emergency signal. The Fire Starter itself is compact enough to fit comfortably in your driest pocket-and, of course, it makes an essential addition to your dry-box supplies or survival gear.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1017951325.jpg

It flexes on impact and won't break, kink or corrode. That's why we're confident enough to guarantee it for life.  If we could guarantee it for longer than a lifetime, we would.  Cool, Quiet, Power:Nothing runs cooler or more quietly than a Minn Kota. Our extra large windings and commutators dissipate heat, resulting in cooler operation, extended battery power, and longer motor life. And our unique bearing system reduces friction to cut fish-spooking noise. So quiet, they'll never hear you coming.  2-Year Warranty: This motor is backed up with Minn Kota's two-year warranty.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1022519122.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/650/1022519122.jpg

Take a look at our new orange Leek.  The brilliant orange of the anodized-aluminum handle is a fade-resistant, scratch-resistant dye that's permanently bonded to the aluminum-so it looks good now, and will continue to look good later. The business end of the knife is a task-ready 3-inch blade of Sandvik 14C28N stainless steel, a steel designed in a partnership between Kershaw and Sandvik. This high-performance steel enables us to make the Leek's blade razor sharp out of the box and helps it hold that edge, too. The modified drop-point blade shape makes it a good slicing knife, while the slim tip gives it excellent piercing and detail work capabilities. Whether you're left-handed or right-handed, it's easy to open your orange Leek with SpeedSafe assisted opening. A simple pull back on the ambidextrous flipper blade protrusion or push outward on the thumbstud and the Leek's blade is ready to go to work. For safety, a locking liner keeps the blade locked open during use and a Tip-Lock slider locks it closed when folded. The pocketclip is reversible for tip-up or tip-down carry and the handle is drilled to accept a lanyard. The orange Leek is a slim, easy-to-carry design that gives you plenty of cutting versatility-and good looks.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1033196684.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/650/1033196684.jpg

You can do it yourself, and save the money on a costly installation. Talon's innovative design - featuring minimal moving parts, no hinge points and a motor that stays above the waterline - ensures that you're always in stealth mode.  Stays silent below the water - thanks to a motor that is always a few feet above the waterline.  The competition's noisy hydraulic pump sits in the bilge, right where the fish can hear it coming.User-Selectable Anchoring ModesAnchoring in hard bottom isn't the same as anchoring into mud.With Talon, you can choose between multiple modes to ensure the right hold and fast, easy anchor retraction.AUTO-DRIVE MODE: Powers the spike into the bottom with three increasingly aggressive hits.SOFT BOTTOM MODE: For less aggressive anchoring - and easier anchor retraction - in water with a muddy or silted bottom.ROUGH WATER MODE: For heavy wind and chop, this mode performs three consecutive Auto-Drive sequences at 10-second intervals for a triple-strength hold.Auto Up/Down Hit the button, then get back to fishing. Only Talon has Auto Up/Down, which makes lowering and raising the anchor as easy as using a car's automatic windows. Utilizing bottom-sensing technology, Talon automatically knows when it has anchored, so you don't have to hold down the button and wait.Fast, Vertical Deployment Head-to-head, Talon beats any other shallow water anchor in a race to the bottom. Talon deploys vertically in three stages . While the competitor's extended "crab leg" ties up your lines and costs you fish, Talon's patented sequential deployment is quicker, quieter and stays out of your way.  2X Anchoring Force Talon is built with double the force of the competition to lock you into your spot with unparalleled strength and security. Built-in Wave Absorption Talon allows your boat to move up or down without affecting the anchor. Its exclusive built-in floating suspension keeps you locked to the bottom, even in rough water. LED Depth Indicator Track anchor depth at a glance. The LED lights on Talon show you how far down you're deployed with each light indicating two feet of depth.Deployment Notification Alarm Talon's indestructible composite spike bends but doesn't break - even if you try to take off while deployed. And if you do that, Talon's the only anchor with an audible alert to let you know. Standard Wireless Remotes Two wireless remotes - and a dash mount holder - come standard to give you push-button control of Talon from anywhere on the boat. All remotes are waterproof and can float. Triple Debris Shields Three custom-fit shields on the bottom and inside of Talon prevent mud or anything else from being pulled back into the unit. The indestructible spike goes out, and nothing comes back in. Versatile Adjustments While other anchors limit you to one position, Talon's Quick Release Bracket enables up and down adjustment, 30&deg; of pivoting, and easyremoval when Talon's not in use. Saltwater Tested Over 80 years of trolling motor design and testing taught us how to full combat the corrosive effects of saltwater.  And we build that know-how into every Talon, so saltwater wont' stand a chance.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1029783281.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/650/1029783281.jpg

But now we've kicked it up a notch with an olive-green handle and black DLC-coated blade. The new olive-and-black Knockout still has its namesake "knocked out" section in the handle. This knocked-out piece in the anodized aluminum frame is replaced with a stainless-steel plate to form our sub-frame lock. This steel plate moves behind the knife blade to lock it open safely and securely. Yet because only part of the knife handle or frame is steel, the Knockout can maintain a lighter fighting weight and still provide a strong lock. The result is a knife that's big, yet lightweight enough to carry every day. The blade is a modified drop point in high-performance Sandvik 14C28N stainless steel with matte black DLC coating. The steel offers excellent corrosion resistance and hardenability, while the coating protects the blade and enhances performance. The Knockout is equipped with SpeedSafe&reg; assisted opening for smooth and easy one-handed opening. Just pull back on the built-in flipper or push on the thumbstud and the blade moves out of the handle quickly and easily. The new olive-and-black Knockout also comes with Kershaw's deep-carry pocketclip so the knife can sit all the way down in the pocket. Even better, the handle is drilled for 4-position carry. Lightweight and versatile, this Knockout provides a new color combination that will make it an ongoing favorite.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1031790439.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/650/1031790439.jpg

Russell," and you have to immediately say "first," because this living legend was one of the inventors of the modern knife industry. But despite all his awards and achievements, A.G. is first of all a knifemaker. The CRKT production Sting, complete with a custom high-strength nylon fabric/glass filled nylon sheath, is a multipurpose one-piece utility knife that is just about indestructible.Hot forging is the reason the Sting is so tough. It begins life as an ordinary blank of 1050 carbon steel, similar to the alloy used in traditional Samurai swords, which is first hot forged and then precision ground into final shape. We apply a black non-reflective powder coat finish to resist corrosion.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1019366304.jpg

With multiple control options, it can be difficult to decide between the beautiful elegance of anInsteon KeypadLinc wall-mounted controller and the convenience of an Insteon ControLinc Tabletop Controller. Get the full advantage of both by installing a KeypadLinc in the Keypad Tabletop Enclosure, an attractive, portable enclosure that allows full use of a KeypadLinc 6- or 8-button keypad while allowing the freedom to place the plug-in controller in any room of your home.Note: not compatible with the dual-band KeypadLinc switch.Easy InstallationYou don't need to be an electrician to install your Insteon KeypadLinc in the Keypad Tabletop Enclosure. Simply follow the included quick-start guide to connect each wire on your KeypadLinc to the corresponding wire on the included power cord. Wire nuts are included for ease of use. Plug the Keypad Tabletop Enclosure into any non-switched outlet. You'll be able to link the individual keypad buttons to lights or groups of lights in your home for remote control of lights and scenes at the press of a button. Once configured, this portable controller can be unplugged and moved anywhere in your home without losing its programming.KeypadLincs &amp; Keypad Tabletop Enclosures Available as KitsIf you don't have a KeypadLinc ready to install in your Keypad Tabletop Enclosure, you can purchase a kit that includes a KeypadLinc along with the enclosure for your convenience. For the ultimate in personalization and convenience, order the Insteon KeypadLinc Tabletop Controller (ships pre-assembled) with a set of six or eight custom-etched buttons.The Keypad Tabletop Enclosure is also available in black.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1027722966.jpg	
'2406H'	'2406H'	Home Automation	Insteon	SignaLinc Phase Coupler, Hardwire	0	0	0	0	         18.22	'891114000112'	         24.99	.23	4.4	2.4	2.2	24.99	Home Monitoring	Are lights or appliances in one area of your house having trouble receiving signals from INSTEON transmitters in another area of the house? This problem is easily correctable with the INSTEON Hardwired SignaLinc Phase Coupler (also called a signal bridge).Because most homes have 2-phase 220V power that splits into two separate 110V legs, sometimes automation commands have a hard time making the transition from one leg to the other. But connect the Hardwired INSTEON SignaLinc Phase Coupler to your home's breaker box, and it will bridge INSTEON signals between the two power lines in your home easily, allowing virtually all of your automation receivers to respond to INSTEON signals.How do I Know I Need a SignaLinc? Here is an easy test you can perform to see if your home would benefit from a SignaLinc. Find the INSTEON-compatible transmitter and receiver that never seem to work together and try sending a signal between the two right now (still not working, right?). Then, turn on a 220-volt appliance, like your electric oven, clothes dryer, or central air conditioning. It has to be an all-electric appliance; turning on a gas dryer won't work. Now, go back to the transmitter and re-send the signal to that problematic module. If it now works, then you've proven that a SignaLinc will help the INSTEON signals in your home. In this test, the 220-volt appliance acted like a phase coupler.New Design, Only Two Wires to ConnectUnlike many other hardwired solutions that require a neutral connection, the Hardwired INSTEON SignaLinc Phase Coupler offers easy two-wire connection (plus the ground wire). That makes it ideal for older homes that may have a limited number of openings on the neutral bus bar. Additionally, the two-wire design allowed our engineers to improve the coupling between phases over traditional signal bridges.Can I Install it Myself?In most cases, yes. If you've ever replaced a broken circuit breaker, then you have the experience to install a phase coupler. You will need two dedicated 15-amp circuit breakers (available at a home improvement center). If you have more than one electrical panel, the SignaLinc should be installed at the panel closest to the point where electricity enters the building. If you choose to have an electrician install it, it should be no more than an hour's job to mount and wire it.Note: The Hardwired INSTEON SignaLinc Phase Coupler is a passive coupler and does not amplify the signal. This means the signal coupled onto the receiving phase will be no stronger than the original signal on the transmitting phase. How well the SignaLinc works in your home is dependent on many factors, including signal strength for the transmission phase.The Hardwired INSTEON SignaLinc Phase Coupler has been tested, investigated and found to comply with the requirements of the Standard(s) for Information Technology Equipment (UL-1950) and are identified with the ETL Listed Mark. The product with this mark on it has been certified by Intertek Testing Services (ITS). This certification mark indicates that the product has been tested to and has met the minimum requirements of a widely recognized (consensus) U.S. product safety standard, that the manufacturing site has been audited, and that the applicant has agreed to a program of periodic factory follow-up inspections to verify continued conformance.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1027676419.jpg

The Torreya&trade;, designed by Steve Jernigan of Milton, FL, performs like a big hunting knife but in a much more manageable size. A throwback to another era, the Torreya&trade; has a classic hunting style with a large 3.6" drop-point blade that can handle many outdoor tasks. While it's able to clean elk in the field it also feels comfortable back at the ranch on a gentleman's belt. The full-sized tough resin infused fiber handle is shaped in a way that provides you with a good grip on jobs that'd normally require a fixed blade knife. Simply put, the Torreya&trade; doesn't know it's supposed to be a folding blade when it comes to hunting tasks. While rare for folding knives, it comes with a sheath that offers a reinforced nylon belt loop that opens and closes via hook and loop. Whether it's scuba diving in his home state of Florida or hunting game out West, Jernigan has had a knife in his hand for as long as he can remember. So it was only natural that he'd want to evolve the fixed blades th.at he grew up loving. If you're looking for a folder that doesn't act like one in the field, reach for the Torreya&trade;.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1031048773.jpg

Few people know more about survival than Bear Grylls, ex-British Special Forces officer, experienced mountaineer and respected survival trainer. Taking advantage of Gerber's decades of experience and Bear Grylls' adventure knowledge, the Survival AO folder gives its user the ability to engage with the surroundings in perpetual survival mode. IMMEDIATE ACCESS FOR SURVIVAL INSURANCEQuick access to the blade of a folding knife is imperative in survival situations. The Survival AO, featuring an assisted opening blade that deploys reliably and quickly with one hand, responds for instant use when the situation demands it. Using Gerber's FAST 2.0 technology, the Survival AO implements both a plunge lock and a safety lock. The safety barrel lock will keep the blade closed when in a pocket, or as a secondary lock when opened. Closing the knife is a simple one-hand process: after the plunge lock is released, simply press it down against a firm surface.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1027192456.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/1300/1027192456.jpg

The Creator 3D printer has a built-in LCD screen and tactile touch-responsive keypads for customizing options. Since the Creator 3D printer comes with both a 2GB Secure Digital (SD) memory card and a USB cable, you'll have two options for transferring your 3D models to the Creator for printing. The Creator 3D printer supports both .stl and .x3g file formats and utilizes both ABS and PLA filaments in a variety of colors.The Creator 3D printer supports layer resolutions from 500 microns to up to 100 microns and can print a 3D model that is up to 300 cubic inches in volume. The build plate is leveled and heated during 3D printing to ensure easy removal of the 3D model after it's done printing.MK-8 Dual ExtruderWith the upgraded MK-8 dual extruder, the Creator 3D printer can print in two colors of PLA filament, eliminating the need for constant monitoring when printing. The dual extruder also removes the need to switch out filaments during a two-color 3D print job. User-Friendly Interface & Touch-Responsive KeypadsThe Creator 3D printer has tactile touch-responsive keypads located directly on its wooden case. From monitoring the extruder temperature to changing filaments, you'll be able to directly customize your settings on the Creator 3D printer itself. ConnectivityYou can transfer your ready-to-print designs into the Creator 3D printer directly with the included 2GB Secure Digital memory card, which frees up your computer from having to use a cable.

Fan of the neck knife? Check out the Kershaw Dune. As a backup knife, an easy-to-access utility blade, or just an unobtrusive, easy-to-carry EDC, neck knives are becoming a top choice for many knife users. Not only does ours look awesome, at 3.8 inches, the Dune's blade is longer than other neck knives, providing more usable slicing area. It also has a tanto tip ideal for piercing-as well as an overall sword-like blade design that gives it an unmistakable style. For solid reliability, the Dune is a full-tang knife and has textured, glass-filled nylon scales that make for a lightweight and durable knife with a secure grip. Naturally, the Dune includes its own molded sheath that snaps the knife securely into position, yet releases quickly when needed. The Kershaw logo "K" molded into the sheath lets knife users know they're carrying the best with Kershaw.Molded sheath, lanyardFull tang constructionSteel: 3Cr13, black-oxide finish; Handle: Injection moldedBlade length: 3.8 Inch (9.7 cm); Overall length: 7.7 Inch (19.8 cm)Weight: 2.5 Ounce (72 g)	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/4008XKER_300.jpg	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/4008XKER.jpg

Maximize your angling experience with the Humminbird HELIX 5 SI GPS fishfinder GPS system.WELCOME TO SIDE IMAGINGIt’s all in the details. Gain a 180 degree side-to-side perspective on the world below the surface with remarkable Humminbird® Side Imaging®. In an instant, the ultra-thin beam scans the area up to 240 feet to the left and right of your boat location—for total coverage of up to 480 feet. The return image for each slice is then added to the images taken immediately before and after to build an incredible view of the lake bottom. You can then magnify the detail of the image with the zoom feature or mark the GPS location of promising cover or structure directly on the screen.Side Imaging's high-frequency beams reveal structure, cover, and contour changes with crystal clarity. The images are so real you might think it’s a camera, but it’s not, so it doesn’t matter how murky the water is.HUMMINBIRD DOWN IMAGINGSometimes, to catch fish, not only do you have to think like one, you've got to see like one. Get a fish-eye’s view of what’s happening below your boat with Humminbird® Down Imaging®. These incredible images are created with high frequency sound waves emitted in ultra-thin slices. The sonar returns from these waves produce a “portrait.” As you patrol the water, you’ll watch fish, reefs, timber, brush, bridge pilings, rocks, and any other structure or cover pop with stunning detail.SWITCHFIREBuilding on our legacy of sonar innovation, exclusive Humminbird® SwitchFire™ puts anglers in complete command of how their sonar returns appear. With two unique display modes, you can adjust to your fishing conditions on the fly. Add or remove detail; account for water depth, temperature and turbulence; even experiment with lure presentations—all at the push of a button. SwitchFire adds a whole new dimension to 2D fish-finding. It’s one more reason Humminbird is simply, clearly, better.DUALBEAM PLUS SONARTwo beams combine for great detail and a wide coverage area. Use the narrow beam for high-accuracy returns and bottom. Use the wide beam when you want a larger search area.UPGRADEABLE SOFTWAREUp-gradable Software -- Access software updates to enhance the performance of your Humminbird unit through our My Humminbird section of the site.PRECISION GPSGet unparalleled GPS technology out of the box.

Designed for medium-to-large sized organizations, schools, and government institutions looking for reliable, long-term card printing and encoding solutions. HID Global's professional-grade DTC4500e plastic card printer and encoder withstands the daily demands of high-volume card printing. Additional security features - such as password protection and data decryption, locking dual-card hoppers for managing different card stocks, and optional holographic or fluorescent (UV) overlaminates that dramatically increase card durability - also make this the ideal choice for organizations in need of advanced card protection and performance. The DTC4500e plastic card printer and encoder features a modular design empowering you to add, at any time new functionality as the needs of your organization evolve.  For example, an optional dual-sided, printing module can add company- or employee-specific information to the back of a card, such as when a bar code or digital signature is also desired. For production of highly-secure cards that resist forgery and feature increased durability, select either single- or dual-sided holographic image lamination, or go with an embedded iCLASS SE&reg; encoder to streamline the creation, encoding, and management of your physical access smart cards from start-to-finish.  Also available, the Wi-Fi&reg; accessory enables you to print cards anytime and anywhere, over any secured wireless network. The DTC4500e plastic card printer and encoder is fully compatible with HID Global's Asure ID&reg; Card Personalization software which allows for the creation and encoding of custom employee or contractor ID cards, as well as HID Global's EasyLobby&reg; Secure Visitor Management solutions which is a perfect solution for developing visitor ID badges easily and on demand. Backed by a global three-year warranty, each of our seventh-generation FARGO card printers and encoders can be seamlessly integrated to work with other HID products, ensuring that you receive and retain the maximum value from the most trusted name in secure identity solutions.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1035907499.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/650/1035907499.jpg

At just six (6) seconds to print each disc with 100% coverage in near-perfect quality, you'll be stunned at how fast your jobs will now get completed. In fact, Bravo 4100-Series is up to 20 times faster than competitors for similar print quality, making them the fastest desktop disc printers and publishers in the world. Disc picking and transport robotics have both been optimized for speed, too. A rock-solid and reliable new belt drive system is utilized to deliver 300% faster robotics than previous models. The belt drive system also gives you smoother and quieter operation. Bravo 4100-Series is Primera's first disc printer to offer separate ink cartridges for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black (CMYK). This lets you replace only the color(s) that need replenishing; saving you money on every disc you print. This is especially true if you use more of one color on your discs than another. The built-in, high-resolution inkjet printing is powered by Lexmark®, a world leader in printing technology. With up to 4800 dpi quality, it has the highest printing resolution available from any manufacturer of disc printers and publishers. Combine this ultra high resolution printing with Primera's TuffCoat Extreme™ Media CDs and DVDs and you'll get the most professional looking discs. TuffCoat Extreme™ Media discs are highly water, scratch, and smudge resistant. They also have a gorgeous, high-gloss finish unlike anything you've probably ever seen before. Virtually all other brands of inkjet-printable optical media are also supported. In applications such as medical imaging and audio/video-on-demand it is imperative that discs are dispensed out the front of the unit. On Bravo 4100-Series, it's an automatic, built-in feature. On some competitive units you have to manually open a door or a drawer every time – a huge inconvenience if you're doing it all day long.	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/63504R_300.jpg	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/63504R.jpg

The ESH400-K is an ideal solution for securing a single door that uses traditional door components. The model meets an organization's needs of working with any Wiegand reader located either outdoors or indoors. Key Features:  Connects to any Wiegand or Clock-and-Data reader Supports typical door IO - REX, DPS, Lock and Wiegand or Hi-O Reader. (4 inputs and 2 outputs in total). Tamper resistant with IP termination located in a secured area for customers not using managed switches or organizations concerned with physically accessible IP cables Expandable to support 16 inputs and 6 outputs and a second Wiegand/Clock-and-Data reader Manages up to 1000 cardholders/credentials Manages 8 schedules and 3 intervals each day  The solution does not require additional software to be installed since it is equipped with an easy-to-use user interface provided through a standard web browser.

We thought about weight, ease of carry, safety and intuitiveness. We studied the original bowie knife created by Rezin Bowie in 1838. We considered utility, ergonomics and comfort. The result... the Aura fixed blade. We used a high impact and tough glass-reinforced polymer handle that is overmolded with a more pliable material for non-slip comfort. We didn't want a big clunky crossguard that isolated the hand so we adapted the blade design to provide the element of safety and allows greater control. And just in case your extremely sharp and durable edge requires a touch up in the field. Unscrew the carbide sharpener in the back of the handle and reflect that yes, maybe this is a new day in knives. Check out the Aura in multiple fixed and folding blade configurations. Pedigree for the future.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1019395390.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/1300/1019395390.jpg

Designed with the input of seasoned bow hunters, the collapsible tool kit features a full set of eight Allen Wrenches ranging from 5/64 to 7/32 as well as both a Flat Head and Philips head screwdriver. These five essential bow maintenance tools make quick and easy work of any adjustment to a bow at camp or in the field. The body of the sharpener features a rubber grip to make it safe and easy to use in wet or dry conditions. Combining all these features lets the BowSharp&trade; stand alone in functionality, ease of use and results.

With the highest pixel density yet in our ColorEdge lineup at an astonishing185 ppi, 4K image display has never been so smooth. Now you can enjoy the exceptional detail in high-resolution photographs that cannot be reproduced with a standard monitor. Alphanumeric characters and contours are also distinguished with excellent sharpness for the printing workflow. The 4K ultra-high-definition (UHD) screen (3840 × 2160) is four times the size of full HD (1920 × 1080), making it ideal for high-resolution photography or as a reference monitor for 4K video creation. Reproduces 99% of the Adobe RGB Color Space Reproduce the sky blues and lush greens that standard sRGB monitors cannot with the monitor's 99% Adobe RGB coverage. Images shot in RAW can be converted to Adobe RGB or images shot in Adobe RGB will be displayed correctly. The wide color gamut also ensures that the monitor covers 100% of the Rec. 709, EBU, and SMPTE-C standards as well as 93% of the DCI used in post production. Whether you are working with photo, video, or print, this monitor ensures faithful color reproduction for a multitude of creative industries. Built-In Calibration Sensor Automate your calibration with the built-in calibration sensor that eliminates the time and effort of an external calibration device. With the dedicated ColorNavigator 6 and ColorNavigator NX software, you can schedule the monitor to self-calibrate at specific times so you can always be sure that images are displayed with exceptional color accuracy. The monitor will stick to its preset schedule even if it is switched off or not connected to a computer.ColorNavigator 6 Color Management Software For individual users such as photographers that require multiple options for monitor profiling and print matching.ColorNavigator NX Color Management Software For organizations that want to conduct color management from one location. True Blacks with 1000:1 Contrast Ratio The high contrast ratio of 1000:1 produces true blacks that are otherwise difficult to display on a typical LCD monitor. The dark tones retain their depth even when viewing the screen from an angle in a dimly-lit studio. Consistent Color Display with IPS Panel A large screen monitor often exhibits color shift when viewed from an angle. With an IPS panel, more than one person can view the screen at once with little change in color or contrast. Uniformity from Corner to Corner Fluctuations in brightness and chromaticity on different parts of the screen are a common trait of LCD monitors. To counteract this, the CG248-4K incorporates EIZO's patented digital uniformity equalizer (DUE) technology to ensure a Delta-E difference of 3 or less across the screen when the monitor leaves the factory. DUE also counterbalances the influences that a fluctuating ambient temperature may have on color temperature and brightness to ensure stable image display. 10-Bit Simultaneous Display With 10-bit simultaneous color display from a 16-bit look-up table, the CG248-4K can show more than one billion colors simultaneously. This is 64 times as many colors as you get with 8-bit display which results in even smoother color gradations and reduced Delta-E between two adjacent colors. 3D LUT for Accurate Color Display A 3D LUT is included which adjusts colors individually on an RGB cubic table. With the emulation function of ColorNavigator 6 and ColorNavigator NX, the 3D LUT applies a film look to the image so creators can check how it will be seen by their audience.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1031851996.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/650/1031851996.jpg

By using Keri's LAN-520 LAN Port in combination with an NC-485 Network Converter, PXL-500 Tiger II Controllers, which are normally connected via a two-wire RS-485 network, can be connected via Ethernet to bridge long distances within a facility or campus, as well as across any distance where a LAN/WAN exists. This allows customers to combine what would normally be separate sites, each with their own RS-485 network, into a single site for better security management, whether across a corporate campus or across town.Typically, access controllers within a building or group of buildings would be connected using an RS-485 network. If cabling to another building is cost-prohibitive or impossible, but an Ethernet backbone exists between them, the connection can be made by using the LAN-520 LAN Port and NC-485 Network Converter on network segment, which converts the RS-485 network data to an Ethernet packet, then back to RS-485 where the network can be continued. If the customer chooses not to run any RS-485 networking, all controllers can be connected via TCP/IP to take advantage of the existing Ethernet LAN/WAN.	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/LAN520_300.jpg	http://buy.wynit.com/images/products/LAN520.jpg

New PANTONE LIGHTING INDICATOR Stickers make it easy to determine if your viewing conditions are right for accurate color evaluation, specification and matching. Quality of light has a critical impact on color appearance, and making a color decision under the wrong lighting conditions can lead to costly and time-consuming mistakes. PANTONE LIGHTING INDICATOR Stickers tell you at a glance whether your ambient lighting conditions are giving you an accurate visual read of your color. Simplicity itself. Two light-sensitive patches react to your viewing illumination, changing color under different lighting temperatures. Under proper lighting the two patches will appear to match. If the light is not in the proper range, the two patches will appear different. The further your light source is from the proper range, the more contrast the two colors of the indicator will display. Two ranges, many applications.  Got the color your want? Stick with it.PANTONE LIGHTING INDICATOR Stickers have a peel-off adhesive back that lets them attach to and travel with your color proofs, ensuring that everyone in your production chain will make accurate color decisions. Be confident in your color choices. The PANTONE LIGHTING INDICATOR Sticker makes it easy to get color right. Each page contains 40 stickers, product is sold in individual pages.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1032802316.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/650/1032802316.jpg

Well, you might as well be if you're making critical color choices under ambient lighting conditions. Your work deserves to be reviewed properly and accurately and the bright spot in the kitchen or the area by the window just aren't enough. Don't miss the opportunity to catch inconsistencies and errors early and save you and your customers time and money from unnecessary revisions. The PANTONE 3 Light Booths can light your way to more effective and reliable color assessment. Color can appear differently in various lighting environments - outside in daylight, inside retail stores, in your home and wherever else products may end up. Your customers will most likely have very specific lighting requirements when approving samples. Metameric effects, when two colors appear to match under one set of lighting conditions but fail to match in another, are often causes for product rejection if not identified early. This is why having a reliable and comprehensive process for visual color evaluation is so important. Not only are our PANTONE 3 Light Booths stylish and complementary to any work space, they also deliver reliable daylight, store and home lighting options that will help you adequately identify color variations and metameric effects sooner than later.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1032802319.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/1300/1032802319.jpg

Supports iPad2 Video Mirroring when used with Apple Digital AV Adapter. HDMI assures that the best audio/video signal is always sent from the source(HDTV signal, Blu-Ray Player) to the display(Projection Television, LCD, Plasma, etc.). It does this by allowing uncompressed video and multi-channel audio data to be input to the display device through a single cable. An HDMI connection allows input at standard rates of speed, up to 10.2 Gbps. In most applications, a signal booster(B122-000-60) will need to be used with this cable to ensure a signal strong enough for your display.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1010841592.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/1300/1010841592.jpg

The SPDT contacts switch when the button is depressed and return when it is released. The contacts are UL listed with 5 AMP capacity. The PB2E can be used for momentary release of fail safe or fail secure electric locks. If interfaced with a release hold timer, it can provide for timed release of electric locks. It may also be used to input a REX (request to exit) signal to a card reader system. We recommend that the local building or fire safety authority be consulted prior to using exit buttons for door egress.

The NO and NC (DPST) contacts switch when the button is depressed and return when it is released. The switch is UL listed with 3 AMP capacity. Note that the switch type is double pole double throw. Two of the contacts are not factory wired (see drawing below). The reason for this is that all six contacts are rarely required and providing less factory wiring makes for a less crowded hookup. The installer may use these contacts by soldering leads to them.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1018404040.jpg

It is an elegant, portable instrument that fits comfortably in your hand or pocket to take with you wherever you go - from the quality control lab to the manufacturing floor to supplier inspections in the field. Simply upload Pantone, Munsell or any other standards, set tolerances, and quickly see pass/fail indicators when measurements are taken. Using this affordable instrument will boost your color quality when color requirements are too stringent to depend on visual evaluation alone. It is more accurate and reliable than basic colorimeters and removes the uncertainty that can result when using color swatches as the final color comparison. This is due to the fact that everyone sees color differently, color perception is dependent on lighting conditions, and physical swatches can be damaged or deteriorate over time. The RM200QC was specifically designed with color scientists, quality control professionals and production managers in mind.Benefits:  Achieve stable color quality throughout the entire quality control and manufacturing process, including field testing with third-party suppliers.  Manage suppliers efficiently, ensuring that each adheres to a single standard. Control variations between lab formulation, production, and final goods. Control batch-to-batch variations during the manufacturing process, reducing waste and rework. Eliminate issues related to staff experience; everyone uses the same device with an easy pass/fail indication based on approved standards.  This easy-to-use color measurement instrument delivers high reliability and accuracy, often eliminating the need for larger, more unwieldy instruments, especially for field applications and on the manufacturing floor. It is an exceptional tool that delivers accurate color data that takes the emotion out of color evaluation and helps gain faster customer approvals.

By inserting the SNMPWEBCARD into the slot and using the SNMP network management platform, web browser, SSH or telnet, you can monitor and control the UPS and data in your server room, data center or network closet. Keep an eye on site electrical data, UPS self-test logs and logged power events, such as blackouts, brownouts and overvoltages. You can even remotely reboot locked network equipment without disrupting power to other devices when using the SNMPWEBCARD with controllable outlets or remotely switchable outlets available on select Tripp Lite UPS systems. You can also use the SNMPWEBCARD to copy the configuration of a networked UPS and transfer it to another device.Two-tier access allows two people to log into the web browser to monitor or control the UPS, while more than two can simultaneously view activity. If an electrical or UPS problem occurs on-site, you'll be notified immediately via email, SMS or SNMP trap. Real-time clock support maintains current day and date even after a UPS shutdown. NTP (Network Time Protocol) support enables automatic updates to the real-time clock from an NTP server. Multiple protocols are supported, including IPv6, HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, SNMPv3, Telnet, SSH, FTP, DHCP, BOOTP and SCP. DHCP/Manual configuration support enables network settings to be assigned automatically or manually. ALERT-Enable SNMPWEBCARD web interface in Google Chrome v42 (see "Go to Support Page" in the left navigation and click on "Software, Firmware &amp; Drivers for instructions).

With so many unique features, these knives function as a personal arsenal to help conquer chores from the extreme to the every day.The Trident series uses our well-proven means of delivering a knife blade to the open position with SAT (SOG Assisted Technology). Using our patent pending Arc-Actuator, the Trident locks stronger and releases easier than ever before. There is also a built-in safety to lock the blade closed, when it shows red, you are ready to go! What also makes the Trident so unique is the Groove in the handle, which allows the operator to cut paracord, fishing line, etcetera without having to open the blade. The handle also features our trademark variable Digi-Grip pattern for coarser grip in areas that require it. Finally, the bayonet style clip is easily switched for right/left hand carry or removed for pouch storage.	https://content.etilize.com/300/1030355238.jpg	https://content.etilize.com/650/1030355238.jpg

PVD-coated 440C stainless steel blades provide the best edge-holding ability, ideal for rugged field use. The handles are made of solid G-10, which will hold up even under rigorous field use.

One of them has been to engineer the ultimate underwater viewing system. Prior to MarCum's underwater camera mission, much of what was happening below the surface was left to the imagination. Underwater cameras existed in raw form, but the color and clarity usually left something to be desired. Now, with the VS625sd and VS825sd, watch as your imagination comes to life. Rich, full color, the highest definition viewscreens and optics possible, and a complete array of on-screen displays and adjustments make these systems the new industry standard in underwater cameras. From Midwest farm ponds to reefs and wrecks in the Gulf of Mexico, these systems really do reveal lunkers and their secret locations- wherever fish swim, Marcum swims right there with 'em.

This alone justifies the role played by our stalwart VX-1Pro. For the weekend warrior, simplicity is sweet, and that’s the VX-1Pro instruction manual in a nutshell: Open box. Turn on. Commence catching fish. Still, calling VX-1Pro an "entry-level flasher” isn’t completely accurate. Its price tag and intuitive operation make it so. But with 1,000 watts of power, interference rejection system, and zoom, the VX-1Pro boasts features not found in competing systems costing hundreds more. Like its "flashier” brethren, the VX-1Pro also comes complete with a long-running 12 volt 7 amp battery, battery charger, and a padded soft pack. Entry-level?
